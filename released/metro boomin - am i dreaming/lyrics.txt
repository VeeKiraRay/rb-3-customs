Not done fight- ing + I don't feel + I've lost
Am I drea- min' is there more like us 
Got me feel- ing like it's all too + much
I feel beat- en but I can't give up

I'm still fight- ing I don't feel + I've lost
Am I dream- in' is there more + like us
Got me feel- in' like it's all + + too much
I feel beat- en + but I can't + give up +

Uh# wak- in' up feel- in' like the thank- ful one
Count up my ones lac- in' up my fa- vor- ite ones
One of a kind one of one the on- ly one
Got one shot and one chance to take it

Kiss my ma- ma on the fore- head 'fore I get the code red
'Cause I was born bred to go in toast red
And swing by four= ten beef pat- ty corn- bread
In the con- crete jun- gle where my home is

All get fo- cused all range of toast is
For nick- name it's the king that do the mos- test
I was liv- in' down bad in my folk's crib
Now I'm laugh- in' to the bank and the joke is

They want things them folks did or folks get
We've been get- tin' this fly since some poor kids
My rich friends and my broke friends co= ex- ist
They love to mix 'em we know what it

Not done fight- ing + I don't feel + I've lost
Am I drea- min' is there more like us 
Got me feel- ing like it's all too + much
I feel beat- en but I can't give up

I'm still fight- ing I don't feel + I've lost
Am I dream- in' is there more + like us
Got me feel- in' like it's all + + too much
I feel beat- en + but I can't + give up +

I can't find it in my- self to just walk a- way + +
I can't find it in my- self to lose eve- ry- thing + + +
Feel + eve- ry- one's a- gainst me don't want me to be great + +
Things might look bad not a- fraid to look death in the face +

I'm good now now now who's + re- al- ly bad
I choose me now now now what's + wrong with that
Wish you could see me
Now now hmm + who had my back + ba- by
You don't know + no love al- ways will win +

Not done fight- ing + I don't feel + I've lost
Am I drea- min' is there more like us 
Got me feel- ing like it's all too + much
I feel beat- en but I can't give up

I'm still fight- ing I don't feel + I've lost
Am I dream- in' is there more + like us
Got me feel- in' like it's all + + too much
I feel beat- en + but I can't + give up +

Can't + give can't + give up +
Can't + give can't + give + up +
Can't + give can't + give up +
Can't + give up
