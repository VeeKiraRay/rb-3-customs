Uh# wak- in' up feel- in' like the thank- ful one
Count up my ones lac- in' up my fa- vor- ite ones
One of a kind one of one the on- ly one
Got one shot and one chance to take it

Kiss my ma- ma on the fore- head 'fore I get the code red
'Cause I was born bred to go in toast red
And swing by four= ten beef pat- ty corn- bread
In the con- crete jun- gle where my home is

All get fo- cused all range of toast is
For nick- name it's the king that do the mos- test
I was liv- in' down bad in my folk's crib
Now I'm laugh- in' to the bank and the joke is

They want things them folks did or folks get
We've been get- tin' this fly since some poor kids
My rich friends and my broke friends co= ex- ist
They love to mix 'em we know what it is

Fight- ing + feel + 
I've dream min' more
Like feel- ing
Beat- en can't
Give

Can't + give up

Can't + give can't + give up +
Can't + give can't + give + up +
Can't + give can't + give up +
Can't + give up
