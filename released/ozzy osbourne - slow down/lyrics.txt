I'll nev- er both- er keep- ing up with you +
Burn- ing the can- dle at both ends it's true
You know the writ- ing's on the wall + 
Why do you ride to take a fall +

Slow down you're mov- ing way too fast +
Slow down you know you'll nev- er last +
Slow down your haste is mak- ing waste +
Slow down and join the hu- man race + 
Yeah +

I tried to tell you time and time a- gain +
You know you'll have to pay the con- se- quence +
Now you're obsessed + with such a pa- + ce
But slow and stead- y wins the race +

Slow down you're mov- ing way too fast +
Slow down you know you'll nev- er last +
Slow down your haste is mak- ing waste +
Slow down and join the hu- man race + 
Yeah +

You seem to run a- round and 'round in vain +
Peo- ple are say- ing that you've gone in- sane +
Tell me just what you're run- ning from +
One day you're here the next you're gone +

Slow down you're mov- ing way too fast +
Slow down you know you'll nev- er last +
Slow down your haste is mak- ing waste +
Slow down and join the hu- man race +
Race + race + race + race + race +
