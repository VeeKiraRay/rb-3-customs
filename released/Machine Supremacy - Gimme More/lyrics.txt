Eve- ry time they turn the lights down + +
Just + wan- na go that ex- + + tra mile for you
Pub- lic dis- play of af- fec- tion 
Feel's like no one else in the room +

We can get down like there's no one a- round +
We'll keep on rockin' +
We'll keep on rockin' +
Cam- er- as are flash- + ing while we're + dirt- y danc- + ing
They keep watch- in' +
Keep watch- ing feels like the crowd is say- ing

You got me in a cra- zy po- si- tion
If you're on a mis- sion
You got my per- mis- sion +
